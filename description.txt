Cholo's Random Mod is pretty much that. A mod I'm doing to learn about Terraria modding.

Currently adds:

- The Bomber: A Snowman Cannon upgrade that fires a rocket that leaves trailing mines.
- Extraterrestrial Tome: A magic spell that fires a tesla turret that explodes into sparks.
- Dungeon Spirit Staff: Summons a spirit minion that shoots homing lost souls.
- Supreme Manipulator: A crafting station that acts as most crafting stations as well as a demon altar.
